1. I've created the template with the create-react-app command
2. I've also included now the designs in the important folder
3. I also did a quick write-up of all the "states" I expect to see in the build
    3.1. This project does have a Figma prototype but it's for Premium users only (sigh)
    3.2. I'll make do with just the screenshots
4. The next step now is the building of the architecture, necessary files and the interconnections
